# UPM_EXPLORER

UPM Explorer is a web application developed to assist international students at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) in finding the quickest routes from the Faculty of Computer Science to various apartments around the campus. The application leverages Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths, taking into account real-time traffic conditions during peak hours. With UPM Explorer, students can receive optimal route recommendations, helping them save time and reduce travel stress. The project is implemented using Python and Flask, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for route planning.
